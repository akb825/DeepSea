# Render

DeepSea Render contains the interface for the rendering engine. This will be implemented for the various system graphics APIs to be used in the final application.

The central object is provided by dsRenderer. From this, dsResourceManager can be used to create resources such as vertex buffers, index buffers, shaders, etc.
