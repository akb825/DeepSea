 * @remark either framebuffer or viewport must be non-NULL to know the full view range to render to.
 * @param commandBuffer The command buffer to begin. This must be from a dsCommandBufferPool created
 *     with the dsCommandBufferUsage_Secondary flag.
 * @param framebuffer The framebuffer being drawn to. This may be NULL, but can be faster if
 *     specified. If this is NULL, then viewport must be non-NULL.
 * @param renderPass The render pass being drawn to.
 * @param subpass The subpass within the render pass being drawn to.
 * @param viewport The viewport to draw to. The x/y values are in pixel space, while the z value is
 *     in the range [0, 1]. If NULL, the full range is used. This must match the viewport used to
 *     begin the render pass on the command buffer it will be submitted to. If this is NULL, then
 *     framebuffer must be non-NULL.
 * @return False if the command buffer couldn't be begun.
