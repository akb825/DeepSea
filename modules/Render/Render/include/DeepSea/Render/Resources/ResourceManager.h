 * always be a resource context available on the main thread, while other threads require a resource
 * context to be created. Up to maxResourceContexts contexts may be created, which may be 0 for
 * platforms that don't allow multiple threads to access graphics resources.
 *
 * These functions are for using the resource manager in general. Functions for creating and
 * manipulating specific resource types are found in the .h files for that resource type.

 * @brief Creates a thread pool that can be used with graphics resources.

 * contexts. If other operations must be performed on thread start and stop, a standard dsThreadPool
 * may be created with custom thread start and end functions that call
 * dsResourceManager_acquireResourceContext() on start and
 * dsResourceManager_releaseResourceContext() on end.
 *
 * In general the number of threads shouldn't be changed after creation. If it is changed, the
 * number of threads must not exceed the number of resource contexts. If acquiring a resource
 * context fails on a thread, the application will be aborted.
