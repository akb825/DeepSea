# Geometry

DeepSea Geometry contains simple geometry classes and routines. The geometry types provided here are oriented for what is typically used for applications such as frustum culling or geometry production.

The geometry types provided are:

* Aligned boxes
* Oriented boxes
* Planes
* Frustums
* Bounding volume hierarchy
* Kd tree
* Simple polygon triangulation, with or without holes.
* Simplification of complex polygons.
