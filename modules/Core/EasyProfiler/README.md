# EasyProfiler

This module integrates the DeepSea profiling interface with [easy_profiler](https://github.com/yse/easy_profiler). The library is included as a submodule to compile in support, currently using [version 2.0.1](https://github.com/yse/easy_profiler/releases/tag/v2.0.1). This will automatically include the code required to instrument the code, but the desktop application to view the results must either be downloaded from the linked release or built separately.
